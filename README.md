Project name is NUMBERSYSTEM

There are two tasks in two different files.

1. First task is to calculate the even and odd numbers in a given array
 I have created a function named evenodd and in the function firstly I run a for loop starting from first element of array to the last element of the array
 and in the for loop I gave a condition of if the element of is even print even and if the elemt is odd print odd with the number itself.

2. Second task is find prime numbers and make a different array named primearray for it and then two operations of primearray first one is sum of prime array and second one is max and min element of prime array.
 The approch is firstly found the prime number in a given array and all the prime numbrers pushed in another array.
 Next run a for loop on primearray for finding the max, min and sum of al the element in the primearray.
